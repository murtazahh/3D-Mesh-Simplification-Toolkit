# 3D Mesh Simplification Toolkit: Edge Collapse & Vertex Clustering Scripts
This repository provides two scripts for simplifying 3D mesh models: one utilizing the edge collapse method and another using vertex clustering. 
Both scripts aim to reduce the complexity of mesh models while maintaining visual fidelity. 
These scripts are valuable tools for 3D modeling enthusiasts and professionals seeking efficient mesh simplification solutions.

# Edge Collapse Method Script
The Edge Collapse Method Script simplifies 3D mesh models by reducing the number of triangles while preserving the overall shape of the model. 
It utilizes the Open3D library for mesh manipulation and visualization.
